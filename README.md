UNDER DEVELOPMENT CURRENTLY

# Home-Assistant - my configuations
Personal repository for configuration files for Home Assistant. 

The files are what I have developed, with assistance of various forum users and reading and googling to search for examples to learn from. Others are welcome to utilise them, and suggestion enhancements and fixes, however no warranty is provided or implied and doing so is at ones own risk.

Files are located in folders that denote them being esphome configurations and template files, and package files that are Home Assistant yaml to add functionality such as new sensors or the ability to track and cost gas, water or electricity consumption.
